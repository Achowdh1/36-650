I added test cases in the code files for the python problems. The output from those test cases was captured in the screenshots. 

The psychopg2 connection code was taken from the lecture.

For Q5, I the first of the 2 solutions I gave is the main one, the second is just a more spread out version just in case because it was difficult to tell
how many spaces were in between the \* characters from the screenshots in the hw5 doc alone. They both print the triangle correctly, the second just
makes it taller and a bit wider with a couple extra spaces.
